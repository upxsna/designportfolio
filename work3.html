                    <p>Website redesign for Vietnam Tourism. 
                        This is a project I did as part of my bachelors. We were required to redesign an existing app or website. Having been 
                        to Vietnam I noticed the official tourism page did not do the country justice and hence proceeded with this for my project.
                        In this project i struggled with having design blocks or tunnel vission since a design already existed. However I chose to explore 
                        a contemporary take on the same, so as to draw more youngsters towards tourism in vietnam as it also a vital part of their economy.
